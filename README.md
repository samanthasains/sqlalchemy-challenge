# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this repo, I use SQLAlchemy to do climate and weather exploration and analysis in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Find the data file in Resources. Find a script to analyze weather data in climate_starter.ipynb. The app.py file uses the Flask API to show precipitation and temperature results.
